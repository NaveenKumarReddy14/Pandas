# Pandas Basics – Learning Notes

This repository contains my practice notebook on **pandas**, one of the most widely used Python libraries for data analysis.  
It covers the fundamentals of pandas including Series, DataFrames, and basic data analysis operations.

## 📌 What is Pandas?
- **pandas** is an open-source Python library used for **data manipulation and analysis**.  
- It provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured data easy and intuitive.  
- The two main data structures are:
  - **Series** → 1-dimensional labeled array.
  - **DataFrame** → 2-dimensional labeled data structure (like a table).

## 📌 Concepts Covered

- What is Pandas and how to import it.
- Understanding and creating a Pandas **Series**.
- Understanding and creating a Pandas **DataFrame**.
- Accessing rows and columns using `loc` and `iloc`.
- Analyzing a DataFrame with built-in functions:
  - `head()` – view first rows
  - `tail()` – view last rows
  - `info()` – structure and datatypes
  - `describe()` – summary statistics

## 🛠️ How to Import Pandas
